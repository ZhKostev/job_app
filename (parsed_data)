Recovery disks were not included but were quickly supplied when ordered (free of charge).[1;35m\\[0m[31mnAs expected, this PC struggled a bit when playing games (acceptable framerates at low/medium settings in some games), but it was quickly resolved by adding a dedicated graphics card. I chose the eVGA GTX 760 SC 2GB. At the moment, this may be the best card that can be used with this PC, as it fits extremely tight inside it's case. Since it is a dual slot card, and two SATA ports are in the way, these will become useless. Also note that the motherboard won't allow you to do SLI. I also had to replace the stock power supply to meet the requirements of the card. For that, I chose the XFX Core Edition PRO650W, which provides more than enough power for a single card. All in all, this PC can now compete with higher valued gaming rigs at a, possibly, lower price (excellent framerates at highest settings in most games).[1;35m\\[0m[31mnBut, if gaming is none of your concern, you'll be just fine with a stock, Core i3 equipped model and integrated graphics.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mBest PC I have ever had![1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mThis is the fastest computer I have ever had.

I would prefer the power button and the DVD eject buttony a lighter colour so you can easily see them, black on black isn't the best. Keyboard and Mouse are entry level, but good quality. System was up and running within 5 minutes, and runs pretty fast for what I have done so far since owning it for a bit over a week. Big downside is having to spend several hours doing updates, all 157 of them and 3GB download, Dell should have there systems a bit more updated.

Nice touch of Dell to format the HDD with Win7 and an option to update to Win8.1 (8.7 recovery disk included) and even revert to Win7. (I am debating whether or not to go back to Win7.) The case is well designed too. Small footprint, just 2 screws to open, and a nifty lever to easily secure expansion boards. I added a video card in only 5 minutes. I am a Photoshop power user. The 3847 boots up Photoshop in 15 seconds versus 3 minutes with my old Alienware P4! I am now installing an SSD to load the OS faster, although for most users this boots up fast enough. In summary, the 3847 is a definite must-buy.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mAwesome![1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mJust replaced my old Dell with the Inspiron 3847, with Windows 7 pro, 8GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive and S2415H Monitor.

Installation is so easy to do I was up with in 30 minutes and have every thing completely hooked up. This machine is the fastest I have ever started up a new machine. I have not had any issues with it which is what I have come to expect from Dell. Very quite machine and the 8.1 program was not hard to figure out and they have videos to help you. I got the touch pad with it and I also have it hooked up to my TV so I can sit on the couch and use the computer. It has all the power I will need and I can still up grade if I need more. I got the 12 GB memory because I find as machines get older you need to have the better memory and I think that is why my last one worked for so long. It only had 2 GB memory as that was enough back then. I am sold on Dell products. I highly recommend buying this computer. If you are into gaming this one will do fine or you can buy their higher tier computer but this one is more than enough for me and most people who use their computer for every day use.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mInspiron[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mVery fast.

Windows 8.1 was okay but not an OS I liked. For some reason the automatic update icon didn't show up on my computer so I called Dell to ask about it. The technician I spoke to was excellent. He directed me to the Microsoft site for downloading the OS, waited while it downloaded, then walked me through the steps of installing it, a total time of 3 hours.[1;35m\\[0m[31mnBecause the computer has onboard Intel graphics but also a slot for a graphics card I called again later to ask how to disable the onboard graphics should I want to install my own graphics card. There is no option to do so in the BIOS. Once again I called technical support and once again received excellent service. I was given the information I requested without hesitation.[1;35m\\[0m[31mnThe computer has thusfar performed flawlessly without any of the problems that many have reported due to upgrading to Windows 10.[1;35m\\[0m[31mnI purchased an identical computer for my wife. Hers came with Windows 10 installed. There are subtle differences in the operating systems of her pre-installed and my upgrade which makes me pleased that the OS on mine was not pre-installed.[1;35m\\[0m[31mnI also purchased a cordless keyboard and mouse KM636 which I previously reviewed not favorably. I have since learned that when I reviewed that equipment Windows had not yet installed the driver was the cause of the issues I was having. I tried to write a new review or edit the one I had written but was unable to do so which is why I include the comments here. KM636 is a much better than average keyboard/mouse combination.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mGreat System[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mThis computer has been running greatly and I am completely happy with the purchase that I made[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mLove this computer[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mSo much faster than my old computer.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mreview of Inspiron 3847[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mso far, so good. computer is fast, and no iddues @ this time. wish it had a compact flash reader, but that's about all the criticism.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mthe best pc[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mI got this and let me tell you no problem here...love it I would recomended anyone to buy.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mGreat Desktop[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mThe Desktop I got has been working great for about a month now.[1;35m\\[0m[31mnIt feels completely stable and capable of handling anything.[1;35m\\[0m[31mnI'm very satisfied with this computer.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mSimply top![1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mFast delivery (couple of days prior to the originally announced delivery date), fast and stable machine, nothing to complain about![1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mGreat Product[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mThis computer has been so much easier to set up and continue using.

With the new system there seems to be no interference with my radio. There was a slight hash produced by the XP machine, but I got rid of it by using filters. No filters needed with the new machine.

The included GT705 discrete GPU by Nvidia was nice to have at times when I needed to playback 4K 60fps videos and it is great for extremely light gaming. My only reservation with this otherwise great value package is that Dell could have maybe included an SSD boot drive, I'm not asking for much here, even a 64GB drive which the OS sits on would have been great. In this current climate where SSD's are increasingly more common, I sincerely hope it is what Dell is including in the next Inspiron refresh. The included 1TB hard drive on my Inspiron is adequate but definitely the bottleneck of this system.

Upgrade GPU is a must but it is not the biggest issue, the issue is the power supply. It is too weak, 300w. in order for a new GPU, a little more powerful PSU is needed. I wonder why Dell did not upgrade the PSU, for example from 300w to 430w; even with an option? changing the PSU required more attention than just add PCIe GPU. without the upgrade, this is an above acceptable computer. if anyone need it for casual daily task and no game, at all, it will be a good choice.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mnot great[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31msometime programs and desktop keep freezing.

As I was unpacking it I noticed immediately there was something wrong with the case. The back of the case bulges out, as opposed to being square/flush with the rest of the case. This leads to all the ports on the back being RECESSED behind the bulge. You can push on the bulge and make it flush with all the ports but it just pops back out. Obviously unacceptable. This makes plugging in USB devices, network cable, speakers etc more difficult and who knows if it will get worse over time. I am currently waiting on a new one which is disappointing since this is replacing another Dell which died waaaay too prematurely. Probably be my last Dell in light of this.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :web_source=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mWalmart[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :product_id=>1, :created_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :updated_at=>[1;35m\"[0m[31m2015-12-17 11:50:12[1;35m\"[0m[31m}, {:title=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mDo not buy unless you are sure of your abilities.[1;35m\"[0m[31m, :body=>[1;35m\"[0m[31mI have had my Dell 3847 now for 2 months and still not using it as required.

I installed the OS on another computer (custom build with an Asrick board) then i started it up and tested it on my custom computer, it worked perfectly fine and booted fine. Then I plug it into my dell, it's maxed on Ram and is using a new graphics card and I have run the same OS on the same computer, I just installed it on that computer, that shouldn't be a problem. When I boot to the hard drive it said it said it had no boot Device. My Dell has held up and been good to me. I have this problem before but ignored it and just used a different computer.

It sometimes won't show pictures it downloaded until you restart the computer which we have had to do about 6 times within a week. This morning I couldn't get to my e-mails. I tried searcg bars and the quick links on the desktop but neither would work for quite some time. It popped up a new download from Explorer/Windows a couple of days after we got it. After waiting about 15 minutes it popped up another announcement saying it couldn't do it so it was undo the changes it made. That morning when I first started it was the first day I had a lock up. After those pop ups it has been occuring more often and having to be restarted. Not Dependable! So far we are very regretful of our purchase.
